# 1. Simulate the capture-recapture method for a population of size N = 5, 000 
# when n1 = 100 and n2 = 100 using the sample() function (we assume that each 
# individual is equally likely to be "captured"). Determine m2 and calculate 
# N^LP using Eq.1.

# Set initial parameters
N <- 5000
n.one <- 100
n.two <- 100

# Use sample() function to simulate first catch
catch.one <- sample(N, n.one, replace=T, prob=NULL)
# Use sample() function to simulate second catch
catch.two <- sample(N, n.two, replace=T, prob=NULL)
# Find common elements between catch.one and catch.two
m.two <- intersect(catch.one, catch.two)
# Amount of common elements
m.two <- length(m.two)
# Calculate N^LP
N.hat.LP <- (n.one*n.two)/(m.two)

# Answer: 1) m2 fluctuates according to common elements between the first two 
# catches 2) N^LP calculates the ratio between the first two catches and the 
# intersection between the first two catches to estimate the true population 
# size.

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 2. Write a function to simulate the capture-recapture procedure using the 
# inputs: N, n1, n2, and the number of simulation runs. The function should 
# output in list form (a) a data frame with two columns: the values of m2 
# and N^LP for each iteration and (b) N. Run your simulation for 1,000 
# iterations for a population of size N =5,000 and make a histogram of the 
# resulting N^LP vector. Indicate N on your plot.

# Motivate capture-recapture () function
cap.recap <- function(n.sim){
  #n.sim: number of iterations
  #list.sim.m.two: m2 values for entire simulation
  #list.sim.N.hat.LP: N.hat.LP values for entire simulation

  # Obtain m2 & N^LP for each iteration

    sim.N.hat.LP <- (n.one*n.two)/(sim.m.two)

  }# end m2 & N^LP
  # Combine list of m2 & N^LP values into data frame

# 3. What percent of the estimated population values in question 2 were 
# infinite? Why can this occur?
prop.table(table(Output$NLP))

# Answer: The estimated population values in question 2 that were infinite
# was 14.7% of the total number of values. This occurs when the two collected
# samples fail to have a common element (i.e. fish), which results in the
# Lincoln-Peterson formula's demoninator to be 0 and the subsequent answer
# be infinite.

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. An alternative to the Lincoln-Peterson estimator is the Chapman estimator:
# N03C=(((n1+1)(n2+1))/(m2+1)611. Use the saved m2 values from question 2 to 
# compute the Chapman estimate for each case. Construct a histogram of the 
# resulting N03C estimates, indicating N on your plot.

# Extract m2 values from Question 2 Output
v.m.two <- Output[,1]
v.m.two <- data.frame(v.m.two)
s <- strsplit(as.character(v.m.two[,1]), ", ")
v.m.two <- sapply(s, length)

# For Loop to calculate Chapman estimator
N.C <- NA
for(i in 1:length(v.m.two)){
  N.C <- ((n.one+1)*(n.two+1)/(v.m.two+1))-1
  N.C[i] <- list(N.C)
} # end For Loop

# 5. Estimate the bias of the Lincoln-Peterson and Chapman estimators based 
# on the results of your simulation. Is either estimator unbiased when n1, 
# n2 = 100?

# Calculate N^LP estimator's biasedness
sum.NLP <-sum(as.numeric(v.NLP), na.rm=TRUE)
mean.NLP <- sum.NLP/1000
biased.NLP <- mean.NLP-N

# Calculate NC estimator's biasedness
sum.NC <- sum(unlist(N.C), na.rm=TRUE)
mean.NC <- sum.NC/1000
biased.NC <- mean.NC-N

biased.NLP
biased.NC

# Answer: When n1,n2=100, neither estimator were found to be unbiased - 
# specifically, the Lincoln-Peterson and Chapman estimators' values were
# -91.07143 and -1214.831, respectively or were ~91 and ~1215, respectively,
# away from the true population (n=5000). However, it should be noted that
# 1) these values are contingent upon how many values were sampled from catches
# one and two, the overall population, and simply the luck of the draw, and
# 2) mathematically, the Chapman estimator is built to prevent a 0 denominator,
# thus and infinity output as a result.

#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Based on your findings thus far, is the Lincoln-Peterson or Chapman
# estimator better? Justify your answer.

# My current findings suggests that the Chapman estimator is better
# than the Lincoln-Peterson estimator. As mentioned in Question 5's answers, L-P
# estimator(n=~4901) is ~91 away from the true population (n=5000), while the
# Chapman estimator(n=~3785) is ~1215 away from the tru population; also,
# these values are contingent upon how many and what values were sampled from
# catches one and two, the overall population, and simply the luck of the draw.
# Theoretically, the mathematical formula for the Chapman Estimator forces
# the estimator to decrease dramatically as the amount of fishes caught in
# both catches increases in comparison to the Lincoln-Peterson estimator, but
# it also prevents a 0 denominator.


#  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Can we get better estimates using larger sample sizes? Let’s restrict
# n = n1 = n2. Write a function which computes the bias and variance of the 
# Chapman estimator for varying sample sizes n. The inputs for this function 
# should be: N, number of simulation runs per sample size, and n. The function 
# should return in list form (a) a data frame with three columns: 
# n, bias of estimator, and standard deviation of estimator for each sample size
# and (b) the true population size. Run this function using the following 
# arguments: (a) N =100,000 for each sample size, (b) 1,000 simulation runs, 
# and (c) n ranging from 100 to 5,000 (use seq(from=100, to=5000, by=50)). 
# Include in your function an indicator of your progress every time you 
# complete runs for 10 sample sizes. Based on your results, construct two plots:
# (a) bias versus n and (b) variance versus n (e.g., y-axis variable vs. x-axis 
# variable). Indicate zero on both plots and connect the points with a line. 
# Describe what you see.

# 8. An estimator 03θ is called consistent if, as the sample size goes to ----
# infinity, the bias of the estimator goes to zero. That is, E[03θ] gets closer 
# to θ as the sample size increases.This is another desirable property for an 
# estimator. For the simpler case where n1 = n2, could N03C be a consistent 
# estimator? Justify your answer.

# Answer: The Chapman Estimator is an consistent estimator of the true
# population for two reasons. First, as mentioned in Question 6, the
# Chapman estimator is that when there isn't an overlap of common elements, 
# the denominator is articifically set to 1 to prevent the quotient to be INF. 
# Second, as shown in Question 7, the bias and variance of the chapman estimator 
# decreases exponentially as the sample size decreases.

# 9. Explain why the assumptions (a), (b), and (c) listed on the first page
# are unrealistic.

# Answer: Assumptions (a), (b), and (c) listed on the first page are unrealistic
# condition unapplicable in a real-life, naturalistic setting. Assumption (a) 
# presumes the two catches, and each fish being caught, are independent of the 
# others, but location, types of fish, time of catches, etc., play a role in
# how and when fishes are being caught. Assumption (b) presumes that each
# individual is equally likely to be captured, but it's unrealistic because 
# the fisherman(you) simply has access to catching fishes within his vicinity
# not throughout the entire body of water simultaneously. Assumption (c) presumes
# the fish population remains a closed population, whereby there are no births,
# deaths, immigration, or emigration of individuals; but it's also unrealistic
# because any of the aforementioned conditions/scenarios are intrinsic to life
# and what's supposed to occur in nature.
